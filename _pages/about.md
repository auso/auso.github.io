I am a Ph.D. computer vision engineer specializing in 3D computational cameras. In 2016, I joined [photonicSENS](https://photonicsens.com/) as one of its initial employees; the company has since grown to over thirty people.
My academic portfolio includes over 40 publications, with 10 in JCR, 18 in CORE, and 4 in LNCS journals, contributing to an H-index of 15 and over 1700 citations. My research encompasses multidimensional sensing, machine learning, and photonics. I hold four patents currently being utilized, which have contributed to the development of a successful 3D camera product at PhotonicSENS.

I currently also serve as a reader at [Florida Universitaria](https://www.floridauniversitaria.es/) and [UPV](https://www.upv.es/). My ongoing projects focus on applying AI techniques to video games.

My goal is to continue bridging the gap between industry and academia by exploring new machine learning concepts, enhancing optical sensing methods, and advancing photonics technology.
