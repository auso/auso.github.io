My research background spans both academic and applied research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. On July 2015, I moved to Institute of New Imaging Technologies [iNIT](http://www.init.uji.es/) where I am working on active learning, feature selection and 3D image reconstruction. Lecturer in the [Master in Big Data Analytics](http://bigdata.inf.upv.es/) at the Technical University of Valencia ([UPV](http://www.upv.es/)).

I graduated in Computer Science in 2002 and obtained my PhD degree in the same field in 2008, both at the University Jaume I ([UJI](www.uji.es)). I developed my PhD studies at the iNIT as a member of the computer vision research group.
